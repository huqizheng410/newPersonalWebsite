            When I was a kid, my dream was to become a computer geek. The first time I got my hands on a computer, I was completely captivated by this marvel of human intellect. A tiny box and screen, yet through the internet, it held more knowledge than I could ever hope to learn in a lifetime. How fascinating is that!

            As a typical INTP personality (if you don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality" className="text-blue-500 underline">click here</a> to check it out, and you can even test your own personality!). I&apos;m curious about everything around me. You could say curiosity is my primary drive, and logic is the key that helps me navigate through mazes. I&apos;m good at seeing logic, finding similarities, and making connections, so learning anything new seems to come naturally to me.

            Software development is my jam, just like how I enjoy playing Minecraft. Building software feels like constructing my own kingdom from scratch in Minecraft, and its redstone systems were like my CS 101. After finishing my Bachelor&apos;s degree in Commerce at the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/" className="text-blue-500 underline">University of Auckland</a>, I could finally embark on my beloved coding journey. That&apos;s why I chose to continue with a Master of Information Technology at the same University.
